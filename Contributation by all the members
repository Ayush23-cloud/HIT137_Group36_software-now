All team members actively contributed to the project using Git for version control and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the primary development environment. Each member consistently committed their changes to the shared Git repository, ensuring proper branch management, clear commit messages, and timely merging of features. Through collaborative use of Git, the team effectively tracked progress, resolved conflicts, and maintained a clean and organized codebase. Leveraging VS Code, members utilized its robust extensions, debugging tools, and integrated terminal to enhance coding efficiency and maintain high-quality standards across the project. This coordinated approach facilitated seamless collaboration and ensured that all contributions were synchronized and well-documented.
